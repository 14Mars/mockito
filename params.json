{"name":"Mockito","tagline":"simpler & better mocking","body":"![Mockito](http://docs.mockito.googlecode.com/hg/latest/org/mockito/logo.jpg)\r\n  \r\nsimplier & better mocking\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mockito/mockito.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mockito/mockito) [![Coverage Status](http://img.shields.io/coveralls/mockito/mockito/master.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/mockito/mockito)\r\n[![Maven central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.mockito/mockito-all/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.mockito/mockito-all)\r\n\r\n## Status update\r\n18/03/2014 Mockito should work fine with JDK8 if you stay away from defender methods. Lambda usage may work just as good for `Answer`s. We're unsure about every JDK8 features at the moment, like serializing a mock that uses a lambda. Error report and pull request are welcome though ([contributing guide](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/wiki/How%20To%20Contribute)).\r\n\r\n## Current release\r\n06/10/2012 Mockito **1.9.5** ! See the release notes. Should appear in maven central shortly.\r\n\r\n## Moving to github\r\nWe are currently moving a few stuff from [Google Code](https://code.google.com/p/mockito/) to [Github](https://github.com/mockito/mockito).\r\n\r\nFor now only the code repository is moved, other stuff will follow like the wiki pages. Documentation may or may not follow. But discussion group, issue tracker will stay at google (unfortunatley GH PR counters incremented before we had the chance to move our issues).\r\n\r\n## Why drink it?\r\nMockito is a mocking framework that tastes really good. It lets you write beautiful tests with clean & simple API. Mockito doesn't give you hangover because the tests are very readable and they produce clean verification errors. Read more about [features & motivations](https://code.google.com/p/mockito/wiki/FeaturesAndMotivations).\r\n\r\n> *\"We decided during the main conference that we should use JUnit 4 and Mockito because we think they are the future of TDD and mocking in Java\"* - Dan North, the originator of BDD\r\n\r\n[More quotes](https://code.google.com/p/mockito/wiki/Quotes)\r\n\r\n> Over 15000 downloads of 1.9.0 version ('12), excluding maven/Gradle users.

First people who tried Mockito were developers of the [Guardian](http://guardian.co.uk/) project in London in early 2008. Here is how Szczepan explained [why we need another mocking framework](http://monkeyisland.pl/2008/01/14/mockito)?\r\n\r\nFirstly, hats down before **[EasyMock](http://easymock.org/) folks** for their ideas on beautiful and refactorable mocking syntax. First hacks on Mockito were done on top of the EasyMock? code.\r\n\r\nHere are just some of my friends who contributed ideas to Mockito (apologize if I missed somebody): **Igor Czechowski**, **Patric Fornasier**, **Jim Barritt**, **Felix Leipold**, **Liz Keogh**, **Bartosz Bańkowski**.\r\n\r\nNow some other people joined the gang : **Brice Dutheil** then **David Wallace**.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to **Erik Ramfelt**, and **Steve Christou** for putting Mockito on there Jenkins server (continuous integration) for a few years. Now Travis and Coveralls took over.\r\n\r\nThanks to **Karol Poźniak** for the logo :)\r\n\r\nFinally, thanks to **Erik Brakkee** who helps us getting jars to maven central\r\n\r\n## links wrap-up\r\n\r\n### Wiki\r\n* [FAQ](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/wiki/FAQ)\r\n* [How to contribute](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/wiki/How%20To%20Contribute)\r\n* [Mockito for python](https://code.google.com/p/mockito/wiki/MockitoForPython)\r\n* [Mockito VS EasyMock](https://code.google.com/p/mockito/wiki/MockitoVSEasyMock)\r\n* [Related projects](https://code.google.com/p/mockito/wiki/RelatedProjects)\r\n* [Release notes](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/wiki/Release%20Notes)\r\n* [More wiki pages](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/wiki)\r\n* [Old wiki pages on google code](https://code.google.com/p/mockito/w/list)\r\n\r\n### Blogs\r\n* [Szczepan on Mockito](http://monkeyisland.pl/category/mockito)\r\n* [Brice's French coffee workshop](http://blog.arkey.fr/)\r\n\r\n### Other project links\r\n* [Latest documentation](http://docs.mockito.googlecode.com/hg/latest/org/mockito/Mockito.html)\r\n* [Dzone Reference Card](http://refcardz.dzone.com/refcardz/mockito)\r\n* [Hudson continuous integration server](http://hudsonci-oss.org/view/Mockito/job/Mockito)\r\n\r\n### Groups\r\n* [Mockito mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/mockito)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
